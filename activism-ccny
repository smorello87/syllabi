**Description.** What does it mean to be a politically committed individual in the 21<sup>st</sup> century? What did it mean to be politically committed for CCNY students in the 1930s? Did you know that 60 City College students volunteered to fight against fascism in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)? This course will examine political activism on the CCNY campus in the context of the global conflict between totalitarianism and democracy in the 1930s. Students will read and write about the fight against fascism both in Europe and in the US. We will connect past and present by drawing comparisons between the political activism of the 1930s and such current movements as #blacklivesmatter and #metoo.

**Rationale.** This course integrates research in our Cohen Library Archives, digital humanities training, and teaching about political activism on the CCNY campus in the context of the global conflict between totalitarianism and democracy in the 1930s. Of particular interest are archival materials related to the over 60 CCNY volunteers that joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to fight on the Spanish front between 1936 and 1939. In order to introduce students to the research question, they will be given access to a unique text archived in our Cohen library, _Let My People Know: The Story of Wilfred Mendelson (“Mendy”), Student Leader, Organizer, Journalist, Anti-Fascist Soldier Who Fell in Spain July 28, 1938_, edited by Joseph Leeds, and written and published by Mendy’s friends in the summer and fall of 1942. Because this book risks imminent disintegration and because of its historical value, the final project for the class will be to create a digital edition of the volume, annotate it, and enrich it with multimedia collections.

# Objectives

1. The class fosters students’ inquiry-driven and experiential learning in the humanities.
2. The requirements will augment and enrich traditional humanistic study by providing our students with a broader array of techniques in performing critical analysis and problem-solving.
3. Students will read about activism from historical and literary sources, from essays written by cultural critics, from the CCNY student publications, as well as from orphan texts (ephemera such as political flyers and pamphlets).
4. By reflecting upon the manner in which the place in society of CCNY students in the 1930s shaped their decision to fight against fascism, students will be asked to analyze and present the way in which they envision their contribution to society in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
